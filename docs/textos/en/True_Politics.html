<h1 id="true-politics">True Politics</h1>
<p>For me nothing need to change, democracy works perfectly, even more
if is like south america democracy ( more people participating, who may
be kings or not, who cares if not what useful is the idea, and how each
can help ) and in fact I see everyone as no authority but with
influences of decisions.</p>
<p>As I try to explain, even without knowing so much about history, we (
brains ) need to fight the single decision of letting go or fighting
back.</p>
<p>The way human brain produce the expression of causality and the body
is called Spiritual, and then the non body ( what is around ) the
condition ( all the reasons )</p>
<p>is logic, while we not always respect that principle.. the principle
of respecting each others.. because when there is no respect, and the
around information show more disrespect then happen events like mine, an
explosion of disrespect!</p>
<p>while I still have conscience about it, I know what I wrote ( We are
not what we say, we are what we do ) and for that, what we say is not
doing? It is..</p>
