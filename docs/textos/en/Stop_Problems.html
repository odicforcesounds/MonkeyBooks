<h1 class="title">How to Stop Problems</h1>
<p>Identify the Problem. Study the Problem. Fix the Problem without
destroying the source of the Problem.</p>
<p>Therefor, we need to solve some milenar problems, but to solve them
we need to expose them! Then we Expose them and therefor we need to deal
with all other problems that are causing the main problem. At the end,
the biggest problem it was only several little problems.</p>
<p>Even then, many will not solve the problem, because the problem is
always in the self.</p>
<p>By the way, America Wish Power, Asia as Well.. Power don’t always use
knowledge to impose power, but sometimes they need ( so they have a
reason for ).. then here I am playing to them… and I don’t need Power..
as I only ask a Path of Shields ( so I can pass through without a wall
who block my freedom of being my self )</p>
<p>Don’t Stop me, Stop Your Self !</p>
