who follow me:</h1>
<p>There is the Monkey who doesn’t See(<b>America</b>), the one who
doesn’t Listen (me) and the one who doesn’t talk (<b>Asia</b>):</p>
<pre><code>- In Theory, I am the creative one, while I don&#39;t care to build what ever goes into my mind...
- In Theory, the one who doesn&#39;t see needs to work with the one who doesn&#39;t talk to help the one who doesn&#39;t listen
to become better...</code></pre>
<ol type="1">
<li>While I am the one who doesn’t listen I may think I am the 4º
Budhist Monkey..</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>I know it is an <a
href="https://art.odicforcesounds.com/pages/Data/Audio/Path_Of_Shields/tracks/10_Myth_illusion_Memories/index.html">illusion</a>,
like all other illusions that become real or still in the fantasy world

<ol start="2" type="1">
<li><p>I add a conversation / discussion menu so anyone is free to tell
me something.. in github/repo</p></li>
<li><p>This text is to those who may be interested in what I wish to
build to everyone!</p></li>
<li><p>My will is to show ways to ensure good behavior in society is
rewarded, since bad behaviors are rewarded as penalties. ( debts /
payments / prison / etc… )</p></li>
<li><p>The value of each singlar human is in it’s behavior, while
behaviors come from educational principles and desires.</p></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><p>(while we wish we need to control the desire or we become
monsters)</p></li>
<li><p>Control - Free to Ask: All emotions are body reactions created by
the brain, which compare information to validate it.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Then we accept.</li>
<li>Then we deny.</li>
<li>Keep learning about information-flow…

<li><p>Is not a system where people give money to help anyone..</p>
<ul>
<li>the only way is by action…</li>
<li>money doesn’t solve problems</li>
<li>in fact, it motivates people to give their own time to solve others
problems.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Does morality / ethics are “superior” values that doesn’t diserve
to have economic value associated?</p></li>
<li><p>I am open to make this application challenge better…</p></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Please, I am just a simple Monkey..</li>
<li>while I love Simplicity I can only handle complexity if is related
to human brain, even then I use intuition not “objectivations of
subjectivity in Time-Object-Focused” called scientific, which care about
the results, not the Flow.</li>
<li>The Flow is the Process, and the process is the Path…</li>
<li>Monkey cares about the Flow (by sea or by air?)</li>
<li>By the Road which goes down into Hearth! (out of this planet it
doesn’t make any sense to me)</li>
</ul>
<ol start="10" type="1">
<li>If “you” want to help me, please tell me. If you don’t like the
idea, please tell!</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>( I may agree with you as well if you specify the “moral” / “ethic”
values that are in cause to report as “bad” )</li>
<li>If you think in the perspective of what can go good(), it is a good
solution..</li>
<li>if you think in the perspective of control, it may be bad (
depending of our intensions ).. as everything else!</li>

<li>numbers are infinite, as the Universe is</li>
<li>The constant is where the concept of infinity comes, because that
concept which points to infite, is giving finitude to what has no
end…</li>
