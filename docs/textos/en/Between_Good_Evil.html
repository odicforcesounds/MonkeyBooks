<h1 id="between-good-and-evil">Between Good and Evil</h1>
<p>If You wish to fight against “good” and “evil”, you must fight that
need to see value and to gain value when searching knowledge. If you use
that knowledge, you are being Evil, if You don’t use it, You are not
being Evil.</p>
<p>We fight for our own need to gain knowledge ( when we are trying to
find knowledge we can assume aspects or proprieties that are benefit or
not to some subject.. then in that perspective of knowledge, there is
good and/or evil ) but lets face it. it is only a propriety of something
bigger that we cannot change, else we will change everything else.</p>
<p>The cycle is always the same.. even when we switch the subject..</p>
<p>Routers deal with this problem better then us.. ( information comes
and goes ) they send it to the target of that message and they don’t
care or even question the content of that message.</p>
<p>Respect &gt; ( functionality )</p>
<p>It is inevitable to be Evil. From the beginning of time, thinking,
reading and writing were acts of Evilness, since knowledge is power
because we can use it. Then embrace that reality that is already
expressed around you and understand how bad being Evil can be. With that
understanding you can make non-Evil choices.</p>
<p>While many believe that being Evil is being implicit, many more
believe that being Evil is being explicit. Both are being Evil if they
have a second intention. While everything that cares in society this
day’s is fully Evil in that perspective, we still embrace that
evilness.. So, at the end of this moral story, the explicit way of being
the self is less Evil than the way of being the self, implicit.</p>
<p>But lets face it again. Being Implicit cares the way we deal with
information and how that information goes into the ones who are paying
attention, it give us some freedom to think if is or if is not true what
we are listening or even reading. Well, in some moments of life, we ask
some expressions without doubts, and if we don’t find them, we become
more and more explicit, until we are tired of being explicit or tired of
being the self.</p>
<p>Then we face the next level,</p>
<p>which is quitting everything ( which can lead us to some freedom ) or
going deeper ( which can lead us to prison or obsession )</p>
<p>By the time I am writing this post, I already know we are all in some
prison box. Or the Body and Mind for the Body. Or the Body and Mind for
the World.</p>
<p>Here in this box, we are Prisoners of Body and Mind to for the
World!.</p>
<p>( 2 in 1 ) or 3</p>
<p>The Body+Mind for the Body (2 in 1 and 2 for 1) OR The Body+Mind for
the World ( 2 in 3+ and +3 for 1)</p>
<p>It does make sense to think that 2 for 1 is healthier and 3++ for 1
is less healthier.</p>
<p>But since in society we live in the condition of being body+mind for
the world less than being body+mind for the body and mind, let me tell
you why you should care to think about one other decision in your
life.</p>
<p>If you are being in the flow of Body+Mind for the Body, you just need
to keep going and do not care about the others, if you are being in the
flow of Body+Mind for the world, you need to stop doing that. You are
losing strength, energy, and that condition will lead you to make a lot
of mistakes. If you have a choice, care about it.. some have no choice,
others don’t care.</p>
