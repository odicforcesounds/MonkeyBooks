## The functional condition of players is always the same: 
1. Do Action: (when action is done, user jump to rate actions(videos))
2. Rate Actions (each use need to rate (lets say: 7 videos, then user can do another action)

## Player [Menus](UserInterface/)
1. <button>Do Action</button> 
2. <button>Rate Action</button>
3. [ShortPathName](Path/) e.g. NCP (Nature Care Path) : Value e.g. [0] - Result: **NPC** [0000] 
4. Rating Menu (activated in the end of video) 
- <button>0</button> (deny) 
- <button>1</button> (approve)

## Users Proprieties
Note: If this application grows... 
- Users Psychological Characteristics Rate (inside companies promotions (commercial relation))
- Professional Users Characteristics State
- Users Personal Characteristics ( hobbies and health )
- Users Actions Challenge Rate / Status. (number of actions per Path) 

## Sensible Data and Storing 
1. [Company_name](BrandsInterface/).
2. Number of Employees
3. Employee Email
4. Points / Coins
5. Users Action Device GPS Points Coords (animation propose)

## Not Sensible Data - Temporary Storing
1. Online Video Stream Link made by User. Lets focus on **Youtube API** 

## Services
- When an action is approved, user gain 1 point and company gain 1 point too. 
- User points can be used as coins.
- Company points cannot be used as coins.
- Public Status: list of registered companies names with points association. 

## Video Services
- Users produce action concept proof by streaming a video that is stored in some service like **Youtube**. We only need to know that address of the video user made, to share that video adress as a video to rate, to X users more until rate get 7 positive or negative votes. So, again: if we can know that link, we don't need to store videos ;) 
- Note: Since I only know / read about JavaScript world, I do a relation between using Redux to control User Video Time state.  

## This is a test or maybe this is a challenge
As any contribution is as well, numeric expressions that represent value, money, for each contribution that pass throught all reviews in a pull request, we share a numeric expression that represents value (N) 

- Lets think as simple as (1). 

If this 1 was a dolar is 1 dolar, if this 1 is a euro, is 1 euro, while if is 1 bitcoin is a lot more. So what is the values of this competition actions? Each person is free to associate a single numeric expression that represents value, to the desire value that those actions can represent. 

## Dreams: 
- I wish Bitcoin industry accept that 1 single numeric expression that represents values from this challenge, could be 1 **Bitcoin**.
