<li>Users produce action concept proof by streaming a video that is
stored in some service like <strong>Youtube</strong>. We only need to
know that address of the video user made, to share that video adress as
a video to rate, to X users more until rate get 7 positive or negative
votes. So, again: if we can know that link, we don’t need to store
videos ;)</li>

<h2 id="this-is-a-test-or-maybe-this-is-a-challenge">This is a test or
maybe this is a challenge</h2>
<p>As any contribution is as well, numeric expressions that represent
value, money, for each contribution that pass throught all reviews in a
pull request, we share a numeric expression that represents value
(N)</p>
<ul>
<li>Lets think as simple as (1).</li>
</ul>
<p>If this 1 was a dolar is 1 dolar, if this 1 is a euro, is 1 euro,
while if is 1 bitcoin is a lot more. So what is the values of this
competition actions? Each person is free to associate a single numeric
expression that represents value, to the desire value that those actions
can represent.</p>
<h2 id="dreams">Dreams:</h2>
<ul>
<li>I wish Bitcoin industry accept that 1 single numeric expression that
represents values from this challenge, could be 1
<strong>Bitcoin</strong>.</li>
</ul>
